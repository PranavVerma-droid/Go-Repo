/* https://pkg.go.dev/fmt

Wonderful work getting through the fmt package’s methods! There are many more methods that we didn’t include, but you can read through Go’s fmt documentation for more in-depth information. Remember, each method is unique in its own way, and it’s up to you to decide what you need to do and which method will help you accomplish that need!

In this lesson we went over:

How fmt is pronounced and its purpose.
The difference between fmt.Println() and fmt.Print().
How to interpolate strings using fmt.Printf() and verbs.
The verbs: %v, %T, %d, and %f.
fmt.Sprint(), fmt.Sprintln(), fmt.Sprintf() will not print strings, but formats them.
fmt.Scan() allows us to take in user input. */

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Practice using the fmt package!")

	fmt.Println("This is the End LOL! Written by PranavVerma-droid")

}
