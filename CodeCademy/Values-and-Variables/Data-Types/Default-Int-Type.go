/*
There is one more common way to define an int in Go. Computers actually have a default length for the data in their Read-Only Memory (ROM). Some newer comps may have more processing power and can store/handle bigger chunks of data. These computers might be using a 64-bit architecture, but other computers still run on 32-bit architecture and work just fine. By providing the type int or uint, Go will check to see if the computer architecture is running on is 32-bit or 64-bit. Then it will either provide a 32-bit int (or uint) or a 64-bit one depending on the computer itself.

It’s recommended to use int unless there’s a reason to specify the size of the int (like knowing that value will be larger than the default type, or needing to optimize the amount of space used).

var timesWeWereFooled int
var foolishGamesPlayed uint

Above, we declared two variables, timesWeWereFooled an integer of either 32 or 64 bits. foolishGamesPlayed, an unsigned integer of either 32 or 64 bits.

consolationPrizes := 2

When a variable is declared and assigned a value using the := operator, it will be the same type as if it were declared as an int. In the example above, consolationPrize has the type int. */
